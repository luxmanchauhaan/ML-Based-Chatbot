## What you will create

The process of building a chatbot that can carry out conversations with users using natural language processing is being made.

To start, I have used Microsoft DialoGPT, a pre-trained language model that can generate human-like responses to given prompts. We will be integrating DialoGPT with Flask, a popular Python web framework, to create a web application that can communicate with users via a chat interface.

For the frontend of our application, I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and interactive chat interface. Additionally, I have used jQuery to handle the HTTP requests that are made to the backend server.

Step-by-step instructions on how to set up your development environment is provided, install the necessary dependencies, and create the required files and code for the application. I also have explained how to train and fine-tune the DialoGPT model to improve the accuracy of its responses.
